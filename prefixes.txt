TRG p.69 under ch2 "Basic Sentence Structure" §2.8. Basic Forms:
Of the many verbal affixes that occur in Tagalog, only a rather small subset occur in basic sentences. 

Basic sentences are always: predicate followed by topic, eg "Gumising ang bata."

the topic is an ang phrase and is always definite, never indefinite.

the predicate is what is said about the topic.  a predicate can be nominal, adjectival or verbal.

sentences having nominal or adjectival predicates can be called 'equational'.  those having verbal
predicates may be called 'narrational'

a verb in a basic sentence that accepts complements is called 'transitive'.

complements are things in non-focus relations to the verb.

The affixes that occur in verbs in basic sentences are called 'major' affixes.  the verbs formed
with major affixes are 'major verbs'.

verbs in 'basic form' are uninflected for aspect, ie 'magtrabaho' and not 'nagtrabaho'.

verbs are not actor-focus are 'goal-focus' verbs, of which there are at least 8 types wrt semantic
relation.  basic sentences include only two of these types: 'object-focus' and 'directional-focus'.

in some cases when there are two objects in a sentence, object focus corresponds to english direct
object while directional focus corresponds to english indirect objects:

here the verb is object focus, corresponding to the DO in english, the prize:
Ibinigay ng titser sa istudyante ang premyo.  'The teacher gave the student the prize.' 

here the verb is directional focus, corresponding to the IO in english, the student:
Binigyan ng titser ng premyo ang istudyante.  'The teacher gave the student a prize.' 

However, when there is only a single object in a sentence, the tagalog verb may be either object or
directional focus.

As a general rule, a goal-focus verb is considered object-focus if:
  the topic that it selects corresponds to a 'ng' complement in the actor-focus counterpart
and is considered directional-focus if:
  the topic that it selects corresponds to a 'sa' complement in the actor-focus counterpart. 
(For exceptions to this general rule, cf. § §2.11 and 5.25.)

'derived' verbs are verbs that only occur in derived sentences.

'affix correspondence classes' are sets of major affixes which apply to the same set of bases (roots)

some bases belong to more than one affix correspondence class.

The affixes that occur in basic sentences may be called MAJOR AFFIXES; the other affixes, DERIVED 
AFFIXES. (Verbs formed with major affixes are MAJOR VERBS; those formed with derived affixes, 
DERIVED VERBS. For a detailed treatment of the major affixes, cf. §5.2. The derived affixes — which, in 
general, may be predicted as occurring or not occurring with a given base once it is known what major 
affix(es) the base accepts — are presented in § §5.8 through 5.16.
and p.283, ch5 "Verbals and their Expansions", 5.1. Introduction:
Affixes that may occur in the predicate verb of a basic sentence are called major affixes, and the verbs
in which they occur, major verbs. All other verbal affixes are called derived affixes, and the verbs 
in which they occur, derived verbs.

Major verbs are either AF or GF.  GF verbs are either OF or DF.

Some GF verbs only occur in derived sentences.

Major affixes (17 total):
 -an, ka-an, i-, -in, ipa-, ipag-, ipang-, ma-, ma-an, maka-, mag-, mang-, pa-an, pag-an, pang-an, pang-in, -um-

Some verbal predicates include, in addition to the verb itself, one or more complements. A complement of a major
verb is one of certain structures that stand in a *non-focus* relation to the verb, but that correspond to the
topic of a related major verb formed with the same base.

Major verbs are divisible into two classes on the basis of whether or not they accept complements. 

Those major verbs that accept complements are transitive; those that do not, intransitive. 

(Derived verbs may also be classified as transitive or intransitive. In the case of derived verbs, however, the
basis of classification is the transitiveness or intransitiveness of the major verbs from which they are derived.
Certain derived verbs — e.g., causative-focus verbs derived from major intransitive verbs (cf. §5.8) — are thus
classified as intransitive even though they accept a complement.)

Major verbs: 
 object—verb classes (5.3),
 directional—verb classes (5.4),
 double—object—verb classes (5.5),
 intransitive—verb classes (5.6)

Derived verbs:
 first, those verbs that differ in focus from major verbs:
  benefactive—focus verbs (5.7),
  causative—focus verbs (5.8),
  locative—focus verbs (5.9), 
  reservational—focus and instrumental—focus verbs (5.10),
  referential—focus verbs (5.11);
 then other types of derived verbs:
  indirect—action verbs (5.12),
  ability and involuntary—action verbs (5.13),
  social verbs (5.14),
  pluralized verbs (5.15),
  other derived verbs (5.16).

| NOTE: Generally, intransitive -um- verbs of 'becoming' (cf. §5.6, class J) have corresponding causative—focus
| verbs formed with either i- or ika-, the two occurring as free alternants.
| Examples: i(ka)ganda, i(ka)yaman, i(ka)payat

| Although there are some exceptions, the majority of -um- verbs outside this group (eg, not verbs of becoming)
| correspond to CF ika- verbs only.

| cause of the action is of some importance, as in:
|
| Iniluha ni Nena ang pagkawala ng alahas niya.	'The loss of her jewelry made Nena shed tears.'

  Major verbs: As an AF affix, and in intransitive verbs other than pseudo-transitives, ma- is normally pronounced 
with a short vowel: thus, /magu*lat/, /mali*go'/, /mabingih/. In OF and pseudo-transitive verbs, and in the 
AF verb matuto, ma- is usually pronounced with a long vowel: thus, /ma*ki*tah/, /ma*tu*toh/. Vowel 
length in these latter cases is, however, not distinctive in the usage of most younger speakers, and 
pronunciations like /maki*tah/ and /matu*toh/ also occur (cf. the discussion of vowel length in the derived 
affix ma- in §5.13). 

ma-	(AF major, DF counterpart) mental/emotional
	noun roots of emotion/feeling
	"to be/become X", like an adjective (eg, to be angry, annoyed)
	Hindî akó nagagalit sa iyó.	I'm not mad at you.
	Maawa ka sa amin.	Have mercy on us. (Kaawaan mo kami.)
	magulat 'be surprised at' (AF counterpart of DF kagulatan) 
	mainis 'be annoyed with' (AF counterpart of DF kainisan) 
	matakot 'be afraid of' (AF counterpart of DF katakutan, Kinatátakutan ko ang aso.  Natatakot ako sa aso.)
ma-	(AF major, OF counterpart) these are basically one-off AF counterparts of OF verbs.
	NOTE: There are only 3 of them: matuto, makinig, maligo
	matuto 'learn' (AF counterpart of OF matutuhan) 
	makinig 'listen' (AF counterpart of OF/DF pakinggan)
	maligo 'bathe with' (AF counterpart of OF ipaligo) 
ma-	(OF major) ma- occurs as an OF affix in a very few major verbs.
	OF ma- is the OF counterpart of AF maka-
	makita 'see' (OF counterpart of AF makakita)
	mahalata 'notice' (OF counterpart of AF makahalata)
	In OF and pseudo-transitive verbs, and in the AF verb matuto, ma- is often/traditionally
	pronounced with a long vowel: thus, /ma*ki*tah/, /ma*tu*toh/.

(A few intransitive ma- verbs — e.g., mahuli - are pseudo—transitives. For further discussion of intransitive 
  ma- verbs of 'becoming,' cf. §5.6 "Affix classes of major intransitive verbs.", subsection D.)
ma-	AF, "intransitive" (so these will be SI or A and not PT or APT as those are GF)
	Most of the bases that occur in this class also occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2), and the SI 
	verbs they form, which may be called ma- VERBS OF 'BECOMING,' denote the acquisition of the 
	quality expressed by the adjective; their usual English equivalents involve 'become' or 'get' plus an 
	adjective. Compare: bingí 'deaf,' mabingí 'become deaf'; baság 'broken,' mabaság 'get broken,' etc. 
	Nabibingí ang Lolo.	'Grandfather is becoming deaf.'
	sirâ (masirà 'become damaged')
	bingí (mabingí 'become deaf SI) 
	baság (mabaság 'get broken' SI) 
	mahál (mamahál 'become expensive' SI)
	-matáy (mamatáy 'die' SI) 
	mamatáy 'die'  (note: can be 'namatáy sa..')
	tuksó (matuksó 'be tempted (to)' A) 

As is noted in §4.2, some unaffixed adjectives that lack penultimate vowel length are related to 
nouns that show such length: e.g., basag /basag/ 'broken,' basag /ba:sag/ '(a) break.'  When adjectives 
such as these occur as bases of ma- verbs of becoming, they are identical in form with the related 
nouns, and show penultimate vowel length: e.g., mabasag /maba:sag/ 'get broken.' (See also the 
discussion of -um- verbs of 'becoming' under J, below.) 

ma-	GF, "intransitive" 
	huli (mahuli 'catch (someone doing something)' APT) 
ma-	"A few A and APT ma- verbs also occur (cf. §5.26, classes II.A.3 and III.C.2)." TRG p.307 under
	section "5.6. Affix classes of major intransitive verbs."
ma*-	OF and DF "abilitative/involuntary/incidental action" (cf. §5.13 "Ability and involuntary—action verbs.")
	Derived from the various GF (so-called in TRG "-in") verbs, all of which have these counterparts. 
	These are the drop-in abilitative/incidental replacements of -in, i-, -an, pa-in etc. GF verbs.
	For strict -in verbs, 'ma-' replaces the '-in' inflections.  For the others, their affixes are retained
	in the ma*-/abilitative forms.  Therefore this group includes "mai-", "mapa-", "ma-an", "mapaki-an", ..

	-in form:        magamit - gamitin (gamit + -in) 'use' 
	-an form:        mabigyan - bigyan (bigay + -an) 'give' 
	i- form:         maibili - ibili (i- + bili) 'buy for' 
	pa-in form:      mapatulog - patulugin (pa- + tulog + -in) 'have...sleep'
	paki-an form:    mapakiusapan - pakiusapan (paki- + usap + -an) 'request' 

	Matutupád niyá ang kanyáng tungkulin.	He will be able to fulfill his calling.
