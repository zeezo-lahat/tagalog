ROOTS

if a root has both noun and adj versions, stress will normally be on the penultimate syllable for the noun root and
the final syllable for adj version.
in this case, most conjugations will have stress *shift* to the (new) penultimate syllable (following the form of
the noun root).

"dala" is a notable exception to adj/noun stress following for conjugations

VERBS

_in, *a_in, _an, ma_an, pag_an VERBS: stress will almost always *shift*.  if there are noun and adj roots, the
noun root is generally the one to use:
hilíng -> hilingán, hilingín 
lampás -> lampasán 
alagà -> alagaan, maalagaan
hirap -> hirapan, mahirapan
linis -> linisan, linisin 
bilí -> pagbilhán
bukás -> pagbuksán
handâ -> paghandaán
laban -> paglabanan

daan is an exception

when there is no root with penultimate stress, stress will mainly shift to the final "in" when made into _in, pa_in
*verb*.  (perhaps not if there is i_ verb?  see ayos).  exceptions: bali

for examples, compare labag to lapad.

NOUNS

*_an nouns (_an, ka_an, pang_an), stress will often *shift* to final "an".

ka_an conceptual nouns: usually there is stress *shift* to the following syllable
bulók - kabulukán
buô - kabuuán
ibá - kaibahán

pag*_ nouns don't shift syllable

ADJECTIVES

ma_ adjectives from noun roots: usually stress stays on same syllable:

asó (smoke) - maasó
dalás (frequency) - madalás
igtíng (tension) - maigtíng
