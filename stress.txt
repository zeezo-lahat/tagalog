nagpapátay	to have had someone killed (nagpa)
nagpapatáy	to be killing someone (nagCV)

if a root has both noun and adj versions, stress will normally be on final syllable for adj version.  in this case,
most conjugations will have stress on penultimate syllable (following the form of the noun root).  "dala" is a notable
exception to adj/noun stress following for conjugations

adj roots mostly have stress on final syllable.

when there is no root with penultimate stress, stress will mainly shift when made into _in, pa_in *verb*. 
stress shifts to final "in" (perhaps not if there is i_ verb?  see ayos).  exceptions: bali

when made into *_an NOUN (_an, ka_an, pang_an), stress will often shift to final "an".
may also shift with _an, ma_an, pag_an verb (likuAn, lampasAn, paghandaAn, pantayAn, maramdamAn)

when there is a noun version of the same (ie, same meaning, not just spelling) root, stress tends to be on the penultimate
syllable and stay on that syllable when conjugated

compare labag to lapad.

_in, *a_in, _an, ma_an, pag_an VERBS: stress will almost always shift:
