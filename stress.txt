if a root has both noun and adj versions, stress will normally be on final syllable for adj version.  in this case,
most conjugations will have stress on penultimate syllable.  "dala" is a notable exception to adj/noun stress following
for conjugations

adj roots mostly have stress on final syllable.

when there is no root with penultimate stress, stress will mainly shift when made into _in, pa_in *verb*. 
stress shifts to final "in" (perhaps not if there is i_ verb?  see ayos).  exceptions: bali

when made into _an or ka_an, pang_an *noun*, stress will often shift to final "an".
may also shift with _an, ma_an, pag_an verb (likuAn, lampasAn, paghandaAn, pantayAn, maramdamAn)

when there is a noun version of the same (ie, same meaning, not just spelling) root, stress tends to be on the penultimate
syllable and stay on that syllable when conjugated

compare labag to lapad.

_in, *a_in, _an, ma_an, pag_an verbs: stress will almost always shift:
hilíng -> hilingán, hilingín 
lampás -> lampasán 
alagà -> alagaan, maalagaan
hirap -> hirapan, mahirapan
linis -> linisan, linisin 
bilí -> pagbilhán
bukás -> pagbuksán
handâ -> paghandaán
laban -> paglabanan

daan is an exception
