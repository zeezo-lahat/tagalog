Pronouns as subject: needs to be put inside the predicate as the second word (p.44 PTSI):
Kwarto ito ng katulong namin.  "This is our maid's room"
HINDI: Kwarto ng katulong namin ito. (WRONG!!)

gusto|ayaw <ng> <ng>
gusto namin ng bir.

To have someone do something is usually ipa_, magpa_, pa_in depending on focus:

pa_in - focus on the "someone":
Pinaluto ni Mario si Aling Tess ng pansit para sa handaan. | Mario had Aling Tess cook pansit for the celebration.

ipa_ - focus on the "something":
Ipinaluto ni Mario kay Aling Tess ang pansit para sa handaan. |  Mario had Aling Tess cook the pansit for the celebration.

Could also be:
Ipinaluto ni Mario ang pansit kay Aling Tess para sa handaan.

NOT!!:
WRONG WORD ORDER: Ipinaluto ang pansit ni Mario kay Aling Tess para sa handaan. (WRONG!!)


ipag-in - causative + benefactive:
Ipinagluto ko ng sopas ang kapatid ko (dahil maysakit siya). | I cooked soup for my sister because she is sick.
If this is a non-ordinary thing, the explanation would be needed: "dahil maysakit siya".

compare:
   mahiyâ    to feel shy or timid
   mapahiyâ  to be shamed or humiliated

   mahirap  poor; hard to do
   pahiráp  becoming poor; becoming hard to do (also note stress shift)
   pahirap  burden, punishment

puwede, maari: "as with other modal verbs, they are used with the infinitive of
any given verb according to any focus"

note puwede has mainly to do with permission rather than ability
