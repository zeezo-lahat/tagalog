Kumbagá magtinô ka na.	That is to say, fix your life.
Para siláng mag-iná kumbagá.	They're like mother and child in a sense.
Kumbagá sa halaman, kailangan nitó ng lupà para mabuhay.	Like a plant, it needs soil to survive.
Kumbagá sa boksing, tátagál akó ng maramimg round.	Like in boxing, I will last many rounds.
Matanda na baga siya, malusog naman at aktibo.	Old as he is, he is very healthy and active.
