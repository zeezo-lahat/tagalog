Every sentence has a focus.  It can be a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun.

If not a pronoun, the focus will be preceded by "ang" or "si"/"sina".  If it's a pronoun, it will be an ang pronoun:
 ako, ka, siya, kami, tayo, kayo, sila, ito, iyan, iyon, or kita
( => the focus will not be preceeded by "sa" or "na", etc..)

(ang mga for plural nouns, sina for plural of si)

1) Adjectives can describe the focus: <adjective> {particle} <focus>

(particle is si, sina, or ang.  absent if focus is pronoun.)

Malaki ang bahay.
Mabais si Freddy.
Matangkad siya.
Magaganda ang mga rosas. <- note plural form of adjective.

To negate, put "hindi" before the adjective ("Hindi matangkad si Freddy.")  unless the focus is a pronoun.  

If the focus is a pronoun,  the pronoun needs to be moved after hindi:

Hindi ka mabait.
Hindi siya tahimik.


2) To say "(the) <focus> is (a/an) <something>" where <something> is a noun: <something> {particle} <focus>
This is referred to as an "equation sentence" here.

Hayop ang aso.  (The dog is an animal.)
Karpintero si Albert.  (Albert is a carpenter.)
Bisita ka.  (You are a visitor.)

To say that the focus is a *particular* someone/something, you need to add a focus particle: <particle> <something> {particle} <focus>

*Ang* lalaki ang magnanakaw.  (The thief is *that* man.)
*Si* Andy ang drayber.  (*Andy* is the driver.)

Also, to say the cleaner is *you*. (ie, it is your responsibility) rather than you are a cleaner (Taga-linis ka.):
Ikaw ang taga-linis.

To negate an equation sentence, hindi goes at the front again but this time it's in front of a noun rather than an adjective as with 1) above:

Hindi hayop ang tao. (a human is not an animal.)

3) Relationship between two nouns: the particle "ng"

<specific word> ng <general word>

Some relationships:

* Part -> Whole
 gulong ng kotse (the wheel of a car)
 bubong ng bahay (the roof of a house)

* Member -> Group
 kawani ng kompanya (employee of a company)
 lider ng grupo (leader of the group)

* Thing -> Owner of thing
 kuwaderno ng estudyante (a student's notebook)
 kotse ng pangulo (the president's car)

* Specific location -> place or object
 tuktok ng bundok (the top of a mountain)
 ibabaw ng mesa (on the table)

* Agent -> patient or field
 manggagawa ng sapatos (maker of shoes)
 diyosa ng pag-ibig (goddess of love)

if <general word> is a person, use "ni" instead of "ng".  If it is a list of persons, use "nina":

kotse ni Anthony
bahay nina Angel, Lucy, at Freddy

4) Location sentences - location of focus: Nasa <location> {particle} <focus>

<location> is a noun or noun phrase expressing a location.  The particle "nasa" signals the relationship of <focus> to
<location>.

Nasa opisina si Anthony.
Nasa garahe ang kotse.
Nasa palengke siya.

<location> can be a noun phrase of the form <specific location> ng <place>, as in 3) above

Nasa ibabaw ng mesa ang kutsara. (The spoon is on the table.)
Nasa ilalim ng mesa ang bola. (The ball is under the table.)
Nasa loob ng opisina si Wilma. (Wilma is inside the office.)
Nasa haráp ng aklatan ang opisina ng prínsipal. (The principal's office is in front of the library.)
Nasa tabí ng silya ang laruán ni Tommy. (Tommy's toy is beside the chair.)

If <location> is a noun phrase and the focus is a pronoun, place the pronoun beside the location word:

Nasa labás siyá ng opisina.
Nasa likód iyón ng bahay.

("Nasa labás ng opisina siyá" is WRONG!)
