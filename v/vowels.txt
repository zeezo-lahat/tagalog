u -> oo: you, food, boot
i -> me, see
o -> aw, saw
a -> similar to a in at, but make mouth wider as if you're feeling awkward, wide and flat
e "egg", but exagerate by making a funny face

e-hat -> "egg", but relaxed as if trying to say viet "a" without moving your mouth

o-hat -> "oh", lips round, do not move mouth

a-moon -> same as viet "a", but "a" is long and a-moon is short

o-hook -> duh, uh

a-hat -> same as o-hook and but o-hook is long and a-hat is short

u-hook -> awkward non-english sound, but somewhat like "oo" or vietnamese "u".
       > smile, push tongue back, pinch lips together a bit
       try: say viet. "i", then move tongue backwards, or
            start with viet "u", then move lips toward a smile shape
