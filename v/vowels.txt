u -> oo: you, food, boot
i -> me, see
o -> aw, saw
o-hat -> "oh", lips round, do not move mouth
a -> similar to a in at, but make mouth wider as if you're feeling awkward, wide and flat
a-moon and "a" sound the same, but "a" is long and a-moon is short
o-hook -> duh, uh
o-hook and a-hat sound the same, but o-hook is long and a-hat is short
u-hook awkward non-english sound, but somewhat like "oo" or vietnamese "u".
       > smile, push tongue back, pinch lips together a bit
       can: say viet. "i", then move tongue backwards, or
       start with viet "u", then move lips toward a smile shape
e "egg", but exagerate by making a funny face
e-hat "egg", but relaxed as if trying to say viet "a" without moving your mouth
