trang -> djyang

u -> oo: you, food, boot
i -> me, see.  sometimes written as y, as in quy
o -> aw, saw
a -> similar to a in at, but make mouth wider as if you're feeling awkward, wide and flat
e -> sharp sound, like eng e mixed with viet a  "egg", but exagerate by making a wide funny face.

a-moon -> same as viet "a", but "a" is long and a-moon is short.  always followed by another sound.

o-hook -> duh, uh

a-hat -> same as o-hook and but o-hook is long and a-hat is short.  always followed by another sound.

u-hook -> awkward non-english sound, but somewhat like "oo" or vietnamese "u".
       > smile, push tongue back, pinch lips together a bit
       try: say viet. "i", then move tongue backwards, or
            start with viet "u", then move lips toward a smile shape
            start with o-hook, then move lips closer together

m, b, v, ph, n, l, h, g sound mostly as in english

d-line is like nd with a very subtle "n" sound preceding the "d", and a bit more harsh than english d: "n-duh"

"t" is something like tagalog t, but with a touch of english "th"

"th" is heavily aspirated and kind of like t followed quickly by h, like 't-huh'

"x" is like s, hissing sound.  not like z.

"s" is like sh in northern, but like viet "x" / eng "s" in southern

"tr" - sounds a lot like eng d/t combo or maybe dj

"ch" - like tr, but with y sound following: "dtyuuh"

"nh" "nyuuh"

"kh" is like eng h with lots of breath then k.  fricative sound.

"r" is slightly rolling with possible hint of eng y

"d" is "dyuuh"

"gi" is like z

"ng" like it looks.  let air come through your nose when saying

"c" is like k, but almost like k/g together.  unaspirated

spelling rule for g, ng, and c, if followed by vowels i, e, e-hat, ie-hat (ia):
 for g, ng: add h after them. 
   so ghi, ghe, ghe-hat, nghi, nghe, nghe-hat, nghia 
 for c, write k instead
   so ki, ke, ke-hat..
also, if c is followed by w, have to write qu
note that these rules affect spelling only, not pronunciation
