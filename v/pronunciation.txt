trang -> djyang

u -> oo
i -> me
o -> saw
a -> at, but make mouth wider as if you're feeling awkward, wide and flat
e -> egg, sharp sound, like eng e mixed with viet a.  exagerate by making a wide funny face.  
e^ -> egg, but relaxed, dull/dopey as if trying to say "a" without moving your mouth
o^ -> oh, lips round, do not move mouth
a-moon -> shortened viet "a".  (always followed by another sound.)
o' -> duh, uh
a^ -> shortened o', going up.  (always followed by another sound.)
u' -> awkward non-english sound, but somewhat like "oo" or vietnamese "u".
       > smile, push tongue back, pinch lips together a bit
       try: say viet. "i", then move tongue backwards, or
            start with viet "u", then move lips toward a smile shape
            start with o-hook, then move lips closer together

b, g, h, l, m, n, ph, v sound mostly as in english
c - like k, but almost like k/g together.  unaspirated
ch - "dtyuuh"
d - "dyuuh"
d- - d, but more harsh and with a very subtle "n" sound preceding the "d", and a bit more harsh than english d: "n-duh"
gi * z
kh * h with lots of breath then k.  fricative sound.
ng - like it looks.  let air come through your nose when saying
nh * "nyuuh"
r - slightly rolling with possible hint of eng y
s * sh (northern, but like viet "x" / eng "s" in southern)
t - something like tagalog t, but with a touch of english "th"
th * heavily aspirated and kind of like t followed quickly by h, like 't-huh'
tr * sounds a lot like eng d/t combo or maybe dj
x * s (hissing sound)

spelling rule for g, ng, and c, if followed by vowels i, e, e-hat, ie-hat (ia):
 for g, ng: add h after them. 
   so ghi, ghe, ghe-hat, nghi, nghe, nghe-hat, nghia 
 for c, write k instead
   so ki, ke, ke-hat..
also, if c is followed by w, have to write qu
note that these rules affect spelling only, not pronunciation
