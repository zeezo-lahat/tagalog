Note: words which end with p, t, ch, c can only have rising or dot vowel tones.

spelling rule for g, ng, and c, if followed by vowels i, e, ê, iê (ia):
 for g, ng: add h after them. 
   so ghi, ghe, ghe-hat, nghi, nghe, nghe-hat, nghia 
 for c, write k instead
   so ki, ke, ke-hat..
also, if c is followed by w, have to write qu
