front vowels, unrounded mouth: i, ê, e 
i - "me"
y - same as "i"
ê - dull egg, but relaxed, dull/dopey as if trying to say "a" without moving your
    mouth. open wider than when saying "i"
e - very sharp, like english "e" mixed with viet "a".  make a wide funny face.  

back vowels, rounded mouth: u, ô, o
u - "boo", narrow mouth
ô - "oh", do not move mouth
o - "ah", "saw", wide mouth

back vowels, unrounded mouth: ư, (ơ, â), (a, ă)
ư - 'uuuu'.  teeth very close together.
ơ - "duh".  teeth not so close together
â - same as "ơ" but shortened/quickened
a - sharp "at", but make mouth wider as if you're feeling awkward, wide and flat
ă - sharp, shortened viet "a". 

dipthongs: iê ươ uô 
> the first vowel is always pronounced stronger and longer than the second one.
> when no final consonant, the second vowel is written (not pronounced) as "a"
  eg:
   > bia, which is pronounced as "biê".
   > ươ is written as ưa as in "mưa" (rain) 
     which is pronounced as "mươ".
   > uô becomes "ua" as in "chua" (sour) which is pronounced as "chuô".
>  iê becomes "yê", if it comes after /w/ (u) sound. ie
   > chuyện (story) is pronounced "chuiện".

uiê (no final consonant) then becomes "uya", eg khuya is pronounced as "khuiê" (koo-ee-yuh)

ơ - "duh", "above".  say with slight smile!
â - same as "ơ" but shortened/quickened
    (chớm and chấm sound nearly identical)
ư - strained "oo", mix of "spoon" and "cook", awkward non-english sound coming from
    throat. smile, push tongue back, teeth close together, pinch lips together a bit.
    like "ơ", but with lips and teeth closer together
       try: say viet "i", then move tongue backwards, or
            start with viet "u", then move lips toward a smile shape

note: "y" replaces "i" when no initial or final consonant, after /w/ sound, ie
quỳ ("kwee" to kneel), after l,m,t (mỹ, lý, ty) 

b,g,h,l,m,n,ph,v sound mostly as in english
c - like k, but almost like k/g together.  unaspirated
ch - dtchyuuh
d -  dyuuh (south) [zd - north]
đ - d harsh, with a very subtle "n" sound preceding the "d", and a bit more harsh
    than english d: "n-duh"
gi * z
kh * h with lots of breath then k.  fricative sound.
ng - like it looks.  let air come through your nose when saying
nh * nyuuh
r - dr, slightly rolling with possible hint of eng y ("z" in north)
s * "s" (viet "x" ) ("sh" in north)
t - strong dt sound, no explosion like tagalog t, but with a touch of english "th"
th * t-huh heavily aspirated and kind of like t followed quickly by h
tr * sounds a lot like eng d/t combo or maybe dj (chyuh in north)
x * s (hissing sound)

tones:

none: high, long, flat
up: start low, go up just at the end

words ending in oc or uc -> close mouth at end.  so phúc sounds like "foop"

Note: words which end with p, t, ch, c can only have rising or dot vowel tones.

spelling rule for g, ng, and c, if followed by vowels i, e, ê, iê (ia):
 for g, ng: add h after them. 
   so ghi, ghe, ghe-hat, nghi, nghe, nghe-hat, nghia 
 for c, write k instead
   so ki, ke, ke-hat..
also, if c is followed by w, have to write qu
note that these rules affect spelling only, not pronunciation
