Ma- forms transitive AF and OF major verbs, and intransitive verbs.

Most transitive AF ma- verbs are the AF counterparts of DF ka-an verbs.
Examples are: 

magulat 'be surprised at' (AF counterpart of DF kagulatan) 
mainis 'be annoyed with' (AF counterpart of DF kainisan) 
matakot 'be afraid of' (AF counterpart of DF katakutan) 
hirati (mahirati/kahiratihan 'get used to') 
muhi (mamuhi/kamuhian 'hate') 
suya (masuya/kasuyaan 'be surfeited with') 
takot (matakot/katakutan 'be afraid of ) 
AF: Nahihirati ako sa klima.
DF: Kinahihiratian ko ang klima.
'I'm getting used to the climate.'

There is also at least one AF ma- verb that corresponds to an OF ipa- verb, and at least one that
corresponds to an OF ma-an verb, and there are a very few that correspond to OF or DF pa-an verbs:

maligo 'bathe with' (AF counterpart of OF ipaligo) 
matuto 'learn' (AF counterpart of OF matutuhan) 
makinig 'listen' (AF counterpart of OF/DF pakinggan) 

higa (mahiga/higaan 'lie on') 
tulog (matulog/tulugan 'sleep in/on') 
upo (maupo/upuan 'sit on')
AF: Nahiga siya sa sahig.
DF: Hinigaan niya ang sahig.
'He lay on the floor.'

AF: actor focus verb
OF: object focus verb
DF: directional focus verb

I: intransitive verb
PT: pseudo-transitive (accepts an actor adjunct) or adjunctive—pseudo—transitive (accepts actor and other adjunct) verb 
a: ability/involuntary—action verb

ma- (/ma/) 
AF(O): matuto 'learn' (Natuto siya ng Ingles.)
AF(D): magulat 'be surprised at' (Nagulat ako sa resulta.) (AF counterpart of DF kagulatan) 
AF(I): mabingi 'become deaf 

Ma- occurs as an OF affix in a very few major verbs. (It is, however, a productive affix in OF and DF 
verbs derived from -in verbs — cf. §5.13.)

OF ma- is the OF counterpart of AF maka-.

Examples are: 
makita 'see' (OF counterpart of AF makakita) 
mahalata 'notice' (OF counterpart of AF makahalata) 

ma- (/ma/ ~ /ma:/) 
DF(a): maakyat 'be able to climb' (makaakyát) Hindi nila naakyat ang Chocolate Hills,
OF(O): makita 'see' (makakita) Nakita ng pulis ang magnanakaw.
OF(a): mabili 'be able to buy' (makabilí) Hindî ko mabilí ang pantalón.


Examples of intransitive ma- verbs are: 
mabingi 'become deaf 
mahuli 'catch .. . doing' 
mamatay 'die' 
masira 'become damaged' 

(A few intransitive ma- verbs — e.g., mahuli - are pseudo—transitives. For further discussion of intransitive 
ma- verbs of 'becoming,' cf. §5.6, subsection D.) 

As an AF affix, and in intransitive verbs other than pseudo-transitives, ma- is normally pronounced 
with a short vowel: thus, /magu:lat/, /mali:go'/, /mabIngih/. In OF and pseudo-transitive verbs, and in the 
AF verb matuto, ma- is usually pronounced with a long vowel: thus, /ma:ki:tah/, /ma:tu:toh/. Vowel 
length in these latter cases is, however, not distinctive in the usage of most younger speakers, and 
pronunciations like /maki:tah/ and /matu:toh/ also occur.

PT: accepts actor adjunct
PT: mahuli 'catch (someone doing something)' Nahuli ko sila.
