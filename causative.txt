"dahil sa" uses ika*, with the 'ka' being optional

Note: these can be thought of as active focus as the causer is the focus.

CAUSATIVE-FOCUS (CF) verbs form predicates that select as topics nominals expressing the cause of the action. They are derived from transitive and intransitive -um-, ma-, mag- and mang- verbs. 

Chart 12 gives the affix correspondences: 

AF Affix CF Affix 
-um-     i-, ika-
ma-      ika-
mag-     i(ka)pag-
mang-    i(ka)pang-

(The notations i(ka)pag- and i(ka)pang- indicate free alternation between the forms with and without ka.  Thus: ipag- ~ ikapag-, ipang-  ~ ikapang-.)   If there is already an OF verb without the "ka" (eg 'ipagbili'), the 'ka' is needed.

Of the two CF counterparts of -um-, ika- is the more common. 

Generally, intransitive -um- verbs of 'becoming' (cf. §5.6, class J) have corresponding causative—focus verbs formed with either i- or ika-, the two occurring as free alternants. 

Examples are:

AF Verb                       CF Verb 
gumanda 'become beautiful'    iganda/ikaganda 'cause to become beautiful' 
yumaman 'become rich'         iyaman/ikayaman 'cause to become rich' 
pumayat 'become thin'         ipayat/ikapayat 'cause to become thin' 

Although there are some exceptions, the majority of -um- verbs outside this group correspond to CF ika- verbs 
only. In the case of the exceptions, both CF i- and CF ika- verbs occur. In general, the i- verbs imply that the 
cause of the action is of some importance, as in:

Iniluha ni Nena ang pagkawala ng alahas niya.  'The loss of her jewelry made Nena shed tears.'

The i- verbs are avoided, and the ika- verbs used instead, where the cause of the action is regarded as trivial. 
Thus: 

Ikinaluha ni Nena ang usok.  'The smoke made Nena shed tears.'

At least one AF mag- verb magbili 'sell,' has a corresponding CF verb formed with ikapag- (ikapagbili 'cause to sell') but none formed with ipag-. (Ipagbili does, however, occur as the OF counterpart of magbili.)

Other examples of the derivation of CF verbs are: 

AF Verb                 CF Verb 
pumunta 'go'         ikapunta 'cause to go' 
tumakbo 'run'        ikatakbo 'cause to run' 
magalit 'get angry'  ikagalit 'cause to get angry' 
mag-away 'fight'     i(ka)pag-away 'cause to fight' 
magturo 'teach'      i(ka)pagturo 'cause to teach' 
maniwala 'believe'   i(ka)paniwala 'cause to believe' 
manginig 'tremble'   i(ka)panginig 'cause to tremble'

The topic of a CF verb corresponds to a nominal within a dahil sa phrase occurring as a causative 
adverb (cf. §6.11, subsection (l.b)) with the corresponding AF verb. The predicate formed by a CF verb 
includes an actor complement and, additionally, any other complement(s) taken by the related AF verb. 
Examples are:

AF: Nag-away sina Ben at Eddie dahil sa laruan.  'Ben and Eddie fought because of the toy.' 
CF: Ipinag-away/Ikinapag-away nina Ben at Eddie ang laruan.  'The toy caused Ben and Eddie to fight.' 

AF: Nagbili sila ng kanilang kasangkapan dahil sa kahirapan nila.  'They sold some of their furniture because of their poverty.' 
CF: Ikinapagbili nila ng kanilang kasangkapan ang kahirapan nila.  'Their poverty caused them to sell some of their furniture.'
