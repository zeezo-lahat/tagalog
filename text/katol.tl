KATOL

   Katól is the generic term that Filipinos use to refer to a coil that is
   burned to kill or repel mosquitoes. It is actually a brand name of a
   product of Azumi & Co., Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. The company used to
   export insecticides as far away as Spain in the early 1900s.

   A katol is often dark green in color. The photos on this page show the
   less common colors of blue/green and red/pink. Katol is often burned at
   night and sometimes is potent enough that you don’t need a mosquito
   net over the bed. A popular brand in recent years is Elephant.

   The company Baygon also manufactures katol in the Philippines.

   ** Burning one mosquito coil is as dangerous as burning 75 to 137
   cigarettes because of harmful chemicals like formaldehyde,
   octachlorodipropyl ether and bischloromethyl ether.
