dekker: it is used to introduce something like an adverbial phrase, eg <something happened> nang <how it happened>

   The word nang also denotes an adverb or adverbial phrase.

   An adverb describes the verb. For example:
   Kumain ka.
   Eat.

   Kumain ka nang marami.
   Eat a lot.

   Uminom ka.
   Drink.

   Uminom ka nang kaunti.
   Drink a little.

   Sila ay tumakbo.
   They ran.

   Sila ay tumakbo nang mabilis.
   They ran fast.

   In the distant past, there was no strict spelling distinction between
   ng and nang.

   Many Filipinos and especially foreigners still get confused as to when
   to use each.

   Both words are pronounced the same way. Read about ng.
