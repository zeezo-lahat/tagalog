TUKO

   tukô: gecko

   isang uri ng butiki na isinigaw ang kanyang pangalan
   a type of big lizard that shouts out its own name

   Note that the English word “gecko” comes from the Indonesian-Malay
   gēkoq, which is imitative of the sound the animals make.

   The name tuko comes from the sound of its hoarse cry, often as loud as
   the bark of a dog. According to Philippine folklore, whenever a tuko
   swallows anything, it calls its own name five times. Many Filipinos
   believe these geckos bring good luck, and some children keep them as
   pets.

   kapit-tuko: holding on very tight, like a gecko on the ceiling defying
   gravity
