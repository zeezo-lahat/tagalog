misc notes:

na ito -> nEto

'l' pronounced as 'g' sound or 'y' sound.  "nasa kaniga", etc.  vince dizon DOT secretary.  even youtube translation is putting g rather than l multiple times.  he also says "malaman" as "mayaman"  wtf.
"Wala pong takot dahil alam nila na.." sounds like "Waga pong takot dahil agam niga na.." etc.  maybe he has a slight speech impediment.

sometimes p may sound like b, and m may sound like w:
pumapatungkol here sounds like buwa patungkol

Tagalog phonemes:
/a b d e f g h i k l m n ng o p r s t ts u w y '/

'ngu' sound (eg 'ngunit', 'bangungot'): squeeze your cheeks together.

't' at end of word: put your tongue between your teeth, like making 'th' sound 

VOICELESS STOPS:
/p/, /t/, and /k/ differ from their English counterparts — the initial phonemes of 'pill', 'till', and
'kill', for example — in several ways

Tagalog /t/ is dental, while English /t/ is alveolar.

Glottal stops: /'/ -> [']

There are cases where /'/ is omissible, and other cases in which it is obligatorily omitted. 

A word—initial /'/ is optionally omitted when the word occurs in the middle of a phrase. Thus the 
initial /'/ of a word like ano /'anoh/ 'what' is omissible when the word occurs in a phrase like "sa ano"
'on what', which may be pronounced either /sa 'anoh/ or /sa-noh/. 

"sa ano" -> /sa 'anoh/ or /sa*noh/. 

A glottal stop within a word, particularly between vowels, is also omissible. Thus saan 'where' may be
pronounced either /sa'an/ or /sa*n/.

"saan" -> /sa'an/ or /sa*n/

Word-final /'/ is obligatorily omitted and is replaced by vowel length when the word occurs in the 
middle of a phrase. Thus "mahaba" 'it's long' is phonemically /maha'ba'/ while "mahaba ba" is it long?' is 
/maha-ba-bah/. 

"mahaba ba" -> /maha*ba*bah/

Vowels:

Phonemes: /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, and /u/, and historically /i/, /a/, /u/.

The present five-phoneme Tagalog vowel system has developed historically from a three-phoneme system, in
which there was one front-vowel phoneme, /i/, one central-vowel phoneme, /a/, and one back-vowel phoneme,
/u/. The addition of the phonemes /e/ and /o/ likely came from Spanish and English loan words entering the
language.

/i/: allophones [i] ('beat') and [/] ('bit'). 
                  This ^ is an italic/slanted 'I'.

The allophone [i], an upper-high-front spread vowel, is similar to the English vowel that occurs as the first
element of a diphthong in 'be' /biy/ or 'beat' /biyt/.

The allophone [/], a lower-high-front spread vowel, is similar to the vowel of English 'bit' /b/t/.

While the sounds [i] and [/] occur both in English and in Tagalog, the sounds play quite different 
roles in the vowel systems of the two languages. In English the difference between the two sounds may be 
used in distinguishing two words from one another (e.g., 'beat' and 'bit'). In Tagalog the difference between 
the sounds is never used in this way, and any word in which one of the sounds occurs may be pronounced 
with the other as well, with no change of meaning. 

Although [i] and [/] are interchangeable in Tagalog without any resultant change of meaning, one or 
the other of the sounds is the more usual under certain specifiable conditions. A long /i/ is usually 
represented by the [i] allophone.  As in 'biro' or 'kilos', 'marami', 'labi ko' (labì) (/lAbI-koh/ - 'my lips').

A short /i/ is usually represented by the [/] allophone.  As in 'kidlat', 'labis', 'gabi na' (gabí) (/gabi nah/ -
'it's night now').

A short /i/ in a phrase-final syllable — i.e., a syllable followed by pause — is, however, often represented by 
the [i] allophone when the phrase-final word is being emphasized. 

Many words that have the phoneme /i/ in a word-final syllable allow the replacement of /i/ by /e/ if the word is
phrase-final. Most of the words that allow alternation between /i/ and /e/ in a phrase-final syllable are words
of native Tagalog origin.


e

The two principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /e/ are [e] and [3]: respectively, an 
upper-mid-front spread vowel and a lower-mid-front spread vowel. The allophone [e] is similar to the 
English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in 'bay' /bey/ or 'bait' /beyt/; the allophone 
[3] is similar to the English vowel that occurs in 'bet' /b3t/. 

In the Tagalog of some speakers, the two principal allophones of /e/ are in completely free alternation 
with one another.  Other speakers prefer one or the other of the allophones in some or all contexts, but, since
there is no context in which a majority of speakers reject either allophone, either [e] or [3] may be used to
represent the phoneme in all cases. 

As was mentioned in § 1.6, many words that have /i/ in a word-final syllable allow the replacement of 
/i/ by /e/ if the word is *phrase-final*.

Such alternation between /i/ and /e/ is extremely common in the case of words of native Tagalog origin with
*short penultimate vowels*; and in fact, the great majority of such words allow the alternation.

For some speakers the alternation in these words is entirely free, the two phonemes being used
interchangeably; for other speakers, either /i/ or /e/ is normal, the other occurring under certain
conditions of style or in special contexts. At any rate, both /i/ and /e/ are very common in 
the final syllable of words like the following, when the words are followed by a pause:

gabi /gabih/ or /gabeh/
itim /'itim/ or /'item/
mabait /maba'it/ or /maba'et/

There is also a good deal of alternation between /i/ and /e/ in phrase-final syllables in words of native 
Tagalog origin with long penultimate vowels. The alternation is particularly common in the case of syllables 
ending in /h/. 

lalaki /lalAkih/ or /lalAkeh/ 'man' 
sili /sIlih / or /sIleh/ 'pepper' 
gabi /gAbih/ or /gAbeh/ 'yam' 

It may be noted that the phoneme /e/, except when it occurs as a replacement for /i/ in a phrase-final 
syllable, is usually found in words borrowed into Tagalog from other languages. In native Tagalog words, 
the sound most often occurs as a variant of the diphthong /ay/.

In the Tagalog of certain younger speakers, long /e/ also occurs as a free alternant of the sequence 
/i'a/.  for example, pronounce 'hindi ako' ('not I') (normally, /hindi' akoh/) as /hindEkoh/. 

a

The two principal allophones of Tagalog /a/ are [a] and [a].
