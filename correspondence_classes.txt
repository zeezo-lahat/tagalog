§5.3. Affix—correspondence classes: object verbs. 
As is specified in §2.12, an AFFIX-CORRESPONDENCE CLASS is a class to which a verb base is 
assigned by virtue of its co-occurrence with an affix set: a set of two or more major affixes which, together 
with the base, form major transitive verbs of differing focus but otherwise identical meaning. Bases of verbs 
belonging to the object—verb complement class (cf. §2.10) co-occur with an affix set that consists of an 
actor—focus (AF) affix and an object—focus (OF) affix; bases of verbs belonging to the directional—verb 
complement class co-occur with an affix set that consists of an AF affix and a directional—focus (DF) affix; 
and bases of verbs belonging to the double—object—verb complement class co-occur with an affix set that 
consists of an AF affix, an OF affix, and a DF affix. The various affix—correspondence classes of 
object—verb bases are presented in this section, those of directional—verb bases and double-object-verb 
bases in §§5.4, and 5.5 respectively. The presentation of the classes of object—verb bases is preceded, 
immediately below, by some notes on the criteria by which a base is assigned to its particular 
affix—correspondence class(es). These notes cover: (1) the treatment of bases that occur in two or more 
verbs of identical focus formed with different major affixes; (2) the treatment of bases that co-occur with 
the members of a single affix set to form major verbs that belong to two different complement classes. 
(1) A focus is never represented more than once in a given affix set. Thus an affix set may include 
only one AF affix and one OF and/or DF affix. There are, however, many bases that co-occur with two or 
more major affixes to form verbs of identical focus. Cases of this kind are treated in one of four ways, as 
follows: 
(a) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have clearly different 
meanings, the base is assigned to two different affix—correspondence classes. The base abot, for example, 
forms an AF verb meaning 'reach for' with -um-, and an AF verb meaning 'hand to' with mag-. Since the 
members of an affix set occur, by definition, only in verbs of identical meaning, umabot and mag-abot do 
not belong to the same affix set, and the base abot must be assigned to two different classes. (The classes 
are, in this case, the -um-l-in object—verb class (umabot/abutin 'reach for' — cf. class E.2a, below) and the 
mag-/i-/-an double—object—verb class (mag-abot/iabot/abutan 'hand to' — cf. §5.5, class A.l).) 

(b) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have similar but slightly 
different meanings, and both meanings are expressed in a single verb of another focus formed with the same 
base, the base is assigned to two affix—correspondence classes that have an affix in common. Thus the base 
sulat forms, with i- and -in, OF verbs both of which have the meaning 'write.' The -in verb, however, 
connotes creative writing while the i- verb connotes primarily writing of other kinds: e.g., the writing of 
letters. The AF verb sumulat corresponds in meaning to both the -in verb and the i- verb, and may or may 
not connote creative writing. Sulat is therefore assigned to two affix—correspondence classes, in both of 
which -um- occurs: the -um-/-in object—verb class (sumulat/sulatin 'write (creatively)') and the -um-ji-/-an 
double—object—verb class (sumulat/isulat/sulatan 'write, write to, write on' — cf. §5.5, class C.l).) 

(c) Where two transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have similar but slightly 
different meanings, and only one of these meanings is found in a verb (or verbs) of different focus formed 
with the same base, only the verb with the exact semantic counterpart(s) is considered a major verb, and 
the other verb is interpreted as derived. Thus the base kuha forms, with -um- and mang-, AF verbs both of 
which mean 'get.' The mang- verb, however, has the additional meaning of activity directed toward multiple 
objects, and there is no goal—focus verb formed with kuha that has this additional meaning. Therefore the 
-um- verb is considered primary for purposes of assignment of the base to an affix—correspondence 
class - in this case, the -um-/-in/-an double-object-verb class (kumuha/kunin/kunan 'get') - and the 
mang- verb (manguha 'get (a number of items), gather') is interpreted as a derived verb (cf. §5.16, 
subsection (6)). 

(d) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have identical meanings, 
the base is always assigned to two affix—correspondence classes. For example, the base luto forms, with i
and -in, freely alternating OF verbs meaning 'cook'; both OF verbs correspond to AF magluto, and luto is 
thus assigned to both the mag-/i- object—verb class (magluto/iluto 'cook' — cf. class C.2, below) and the 
mag-/-in object-verb class (magluto/lutuin 'cook' - cf. class C.3, below). 

(2) There are a number of affix sets that may be associated with either object verbs or directional 
verbs. Thus the members of the -um-/-an affix set occurs both in object verbs (e.g., lumunas/lunasan 
'cure' — cf. class E.l, below) and in directional verbs (e.g., dumalo/daluhan 'attend' — cf. §5.4, class D.l). 
In most cases, a given base occurs with the members of such an affix set in either object or directional verbs 
but not in both. (Thus the base lunas occurs in the -um-/-an object—verb class but not the -um-/-an 
directional—verb class, while the base dalo occurs in the directional—verb but not the object—verb class.) 
There are, however, certain bases that co-occur with the members of a single affix set to form both object 
and directional verbs. (That is, the AF verbs formed with the bases may take either an object complement 
or a directional complement.) Such bases are always assigned to both the object—verb class and the 
directional—verb class identified with the given affix set. 

In some cases the object and directional verbs formed with a common base and a common affix set 
differ from one another in meaning. For example, the base hawak occurs in both the -um-/-an object—verb 
class and the -um-/-an directional—verb class, the object verbs having the meaning 'hold,' as in: 

Humawak siya ng libro.  'He held a book.'
Hinawakan niya ang libro.  'He held the book.'

and the directional verbs having the meaning 'hold on to,' as in: 

Humawak siya sa barandilya.  'He held on to the railing.' 
Hinawakan niya ang barandilya.  'He held on to the railing.' 

In other cases, the object and directional verbs formed with a common base and a common affix set are 
identical in meaning. For example, the base kinig occurs in both the ma-/pa-... -an object—verb class and 
the ma-/pa-. . .-an directional—verb class in verbs that mean 'listen to.' Examples of the AF verbs in 
sentences are: 

Nakinig kami ng talumpati.  'We listened to a speech.' 
Nakinig kami sa talumpati.  'We listened to the speech.' 

The first sentence involves the object verb makinig, the second the homophonous directional verb. The 
goal—focus counterpart of both sentences is: 

Pinakinggan namin ang talumpati.  'We listened to the speech.' 

in which pinakinggan (the perfective form of pakinggan) is ambiguously either object—focus or 
directional—focus. 

Regardless, then, of whether the object verbs and the directional verbs formed with a common base 
and a common affix set are the same or different in meaning, the base is always classified as both an 
object—verb base and a directional—verb base. 

In the following presentation, the affix—correspondence classes of object—verb bases are presented in 
alphabetical order, according, first, to the AF affixes, then to the OF affixes, that occur in the affix sets. 
(In the notation used to identify an affix set, the AF affix precedes the OF affix, and the two are separated 
by a slash.) Examples of bases that occur in each class are followed by a parenthetic listing of the pertinent 
basic forms and a translation of the latter. (Wherever possible, four bases are listed for each class. If fewer 
than four bases are listed, the class is an unproductive one, and the listed examples may be the only ones 
that occur. Bases that never occur word—initially are listed with a preceding hyphen.) The examples of 
bases and basic forms are followed by a set of sentences illustrating the affix correspondences. Only one set 
of verbs in each class is chosen for these illustrative sentences. The examples and illustrative sentences are in 
some cases accompanied by remarks of various kinds.

A. Ma- classes (very few bases in each class) 
1. ma-/ipa- (-ligo)
* -ligo (maligo/ipaligo 'bathe with') 

AF: Naligo siya ng mainit na tubig.  'He bathed with hot water.' 
OF: Ipinaligo niya ang mainit na tubig.  'He bathed with the hot water.' 

2. ma-/ma-an (-tuto)
* -tuto (matuto/matutuhan 'learn') 
AF: Natututo siya noon.  'He is learning (some of) that.' 
OF: Natututuhan niya iyon.  'He is learning that.' 

3. ma-/pa-an (-kinig,  which is also ma-/pa- directional base)
* -kinig (makinig/pakinggan 'listen to') 
AF: Nakinig kami ng talumpati.  'We listened to a speech.' 
OF: Pinakinggan namin ang talumpati.  'We listened to the speech.' 

The base -kinig also occurs in the directional—verb ma-/pa-... -an class (cf. §5.4, class A.3). 

B. Maka- classes (very few bases in each class) 

1. maka-/ma- (kita, dinig, halata, pansin)
* kita (makakita/makita 'see') 
* dinig (makarinig/marinig 'hear') 
* halata (makahalata/mahalata 'notice') 
* pansin (makapansin/mapansin 'notice') 
AF: Nakakita ka ba ng aksidente?  'Did you see an accident?' 
OF: Nakita mo ba ang aksidente?  'Did you see the accident?' 

2. maka-/ma-an (damdam, ulinig)
* damdam (makaramdam/maramdaman 'feel') 
* ulinig (makaulinig/maulinigan 'hear faintly') 
AF: Nakaramdam ako ng sakit.  'I felt some pain.' 
OF: Naramdaman ko ang sakit.  'I felt the pain.' 

2a. maka-(nom)/ma-an (limot, tanda)
limot (makalimot/ma(ka)limutan 'forget') 
* tanda (makatand/matandaan 'remember') 
AF: Siya ang nakalimot ng libro niya.  'He's the one who forgot his book.' 
OF: Na(ka)limutan niya ang libro niya.  'He forgot his book.' 
(Malimutan and makalimutan are free alternants.) 
The maka- verbs in this class occur only in nominalized verbals: i.e., after one of the markers ang, ng, sa (cf. §3.24).

C. Mag- classes 
1. mag-/-an (anyaya, bukas, laba, walis)
anyaya (mag-anyaya/anyayahan 'invite') 
* bukas (magbukas/buksan 'open') 
* laba (maglaba/labhan 'launder') 
* walis (magwalis/walisan 'sweep') 
AF: Mag-anyaya ka ng mga istudyante.  'Invite some students.' 
OF: Anyayahan mo ang mga istudyante.  'invite the students.' 

2. mag-/i- (kula, handa, luto, pinid)
* kula (magkula/ikula 'bleach (in the sun)') 
* handa (maghanda/ihanda 'prepare') 
* luto (magluto/iluto 'cook') 
* pinid (magpinid/ipinid 'close') 
AF: Magkukula sila ng mga damit.  'They're going to bleach some clothes.' 
OF: Ikukula nila ang mga damit.  'They're going to bleach the clothes.' 

Most mag- verbs denoting ways of preparing food have two object—focus counterparts, one 
formed with i-, the other with -in. The i- and -in verbs are normally free alternants. Examples 
are: iluto ~ lutuin 'cook'; ipaksiw ~ paksiwin 'make into paksiw, iprito ~ prituhin 'fry.' The 
bases of such verbs are assigned to two object—verb classes: the mag-/i- class and the mag-/-in class 
(class C.3, below). 

3. mag-/-in (kudkod, hiwa, luto, plantsa)
* kudkod (magkudkod/kudkurin 'grate (coconut)') 
* hiwa (maghiwa/hiwain 'cut') 
* luto (magluto/lutuin 'cook') 
* plantsa (magplantsa/plantsahin 'iron') 
AF: Magkudkod ka ng niyog.  'Grate some coconut.' 
OF: Kudkurin mo ang niyog.  'Grate the coconut.' 

Many mag-/-in object—verb bases — e.g., kudkod, hiwa, plantsa — also occur in the -um-/-in or 
-um(nom)/-in object—verb class (respectively, class E.2a and class E.2b, below), the -um- and mag-
verbs having similar or identical meanings. For further discussion, cf. E.2b, below. 
For a note on the alternation between i- and -in with bases denoting ways of preparing food, cf. 
C.2 above. 

4. mag-/ipag- (-kanulo: betray)
* -kanulo (magkanulo/ipagkanulo 'betray') 
AF: Nagkanulo siya ng mga kasamahan niya.  'He betrayed (some of) his companions.' 
OF: Ipinagkanulo niya ang mga kasamahan niya.  'He betrayed his companions.' 

5. mag-/pag-an (tiis, which is also a mag-/-in object class base)
* tiis (magtiis/pagtiisan 'endure') 
AF: Nagtiis siya ng kahirapan.  'He endured some hardship.' 
OF: Pinagtiisan niya ang kahirapan.  'He endured the hardship.' 

Tiis also occurs in the mag-/-in object—verb class — class C.3, above; tiisin and pagtiisan are free 
or dialectal alternants. 

D. Mang- classes (very few bases in each class) 

1. mang-/-an (kuwalta, sakit)
* kuwalta (mangwalta/kuwaltahan 'deprive of money by fraudulent means') 
* sakit (manakit/saktan 'injure') 
AF: Nangungwalta siya ng mga kamag-anak niya.  'He is robbing (some of) his relatives of their money.' 
OF: Kinukwaltahan niya ang mga kamag-anak niya.  'He is robbing his relatives of their money.' 

2. mang-/-in (kailangan)
* kailangan (mangailangan/kailanganin 'need') 
AF: Nangangailangan kami ng tulong ninyo.  'We need (some of) your help.' 
OF: Kinakailangan namin ang tulong ninyo.  'We need your help.' 

Some speakers use kumailangan instead of, or in alternation with, mangailangan, For these 
speakers, kailangan belongs to the -um-/-in object—verb class (class E.2a, below) instead of, or in 
addition to, the mang-/-in object—verb class. 

3. mang-/ipang- (anak, bahagi)
* anak (manganak/ipanganak 'give birth to') 
* bahagi (mamahagi/ipamahagi 'apportion') 
AF: Nanganak siya ng kambal noong isang buwan.  'She gave birth to twins last month.' 
OF: Ipinanganak niya ang kambal noong isang buwan.  'She gave birth to the twins last month.' 

4. mang-/pang-an (talo)
* talo (manalo/panalunan 'win as a prize') 
AF: Nanalo ako ng kotse sa paligsahan.  'I won a car as a prize in the contest.' 
OF: Pinanalunan ko ang kotse sa paligsahan.  'I won the car as a prize in the contest.' 

5. mang-/pang-in (-nood)
* -nood (manood/panoorin 'watch') 
AF: Nanood siya ng palabas.  'He watched a show.' 
OF: Pinanood niya ang palabas.  'He watched the show.' 

E. -um- classes 

1. -um-/-an (hawak, lunas, tangan, tikim)
* hawak (humawak/hawakan 'hold') 
* lunas (lumunas/lunasan 'cure') 
tangan (tumangan/tang(a)nan 'hold') 
* tikim (tumikim/tikman 'taste') 
AF: Humawak siya ng libro.  'He held a book.' 
OF: Hinawakan niya ang libro.  'He held the book.' 

Hawak and tangan also occur in the directional—verb -um-/-an class (§5.4, class D.l). The 
directional verbs have the meaning 'hold on to.' 

2a. -um-/-in (abot, huli, tahi, tugtog) 
* abot (umabot/abutin 'reach for') 
* huli (humuli/hulihin 'catch') 
* tahi (tumahi/tahiin 'sew') 
* tugtog (tumugtog/tugtugin 'play (an instrument)') 
AF: Umabot ka ng mangga.  'Reach for a mango.' 
OF: Abutin mo ang mangga.  'Reach for the mango.' 

Abot also occurs in the mag-/i-/-an double—object—verb class (§5.5, class A.l). The 
double—object verbs have the meaning 'hand to.' 

2b. um-(nom)/-in (basag, kudkod, durog, giling, sunog, gulat, takot, bigo, gutom, hiya, patay)
* basag (bumasag/basagin 'break') 
* kudkod (kumudkod/kudkurin 'grate (coconut)') 
* gulat (gumulat/gulatin 'surprise') 
* takot (tumakot/takutin 'frighten') 
AF: Ako ang bumasag ng baso.  'I'm the one who broke a glass.' 
OF: Binasag ko ang baso.  'I broke the glass.' 

Bases in this class are divisible into two subclasses: (1) those that form -um-(nom)/-in verbs 
that require animate objects: e.g., gulat, takot', and (2) those that form -um-(nom)/-in verbs that 
denote ways of fragmenting or disintegrating an object: e.g., basag, kudkod. Most bases in subclass 
(1) (gulat, takot, bigo, gutom, hiya) also occur in derived mang- verbs denoting actions directed
toward multiple objects (cf. §5.16, subsection (6)). The mang- verbs, unlike the -um- verbs from
which they are derived, need not be nominalized. Thus: 

Nanggulat siya ng mga kaibigan niya.  'He surprised (some of) his friends.' 
but not: 
*Gumulat siya ng mga kaibigan niya. 
(cf. Siya ang gumulat ng mga kaibigan niya.  'He's the one who surprised (some of) his friends.') 

Some other bases in this subclass are: bigo (bumigo/biguin 'disappoint'), gutom 
(gumutom/gutumin 'starve'), hiya (humiya/hiyain 'embarrass'). (At least one base in subclass (1), 
 patay (pumatay/patayin 'kill'), does not occur in a derived mang- verb.  Patay does, however, also 
occur in the mag-/-in object—verb class (class C.3, above) in formations which differ somewhat in 
use from those representing the -um-(nom)/-in class. The -um-(nom)-in formations are used with 
human objects, the mag-/-in formations with non-human objects. Thus: 

Siya ang pumatay ng sundalo.  'He's the one who killed a soldier.' 
Nagpatay siya ng lamok 'He killed a mosquito.' 
Pinatay niya ang sundalo/lamok.  'He killed the soldier/mosquito.' 

Most -um-(nom)/-in bases in subclass (2) also occur in the mag-/-in object—verb class (class C.3, 
above). The mag- verbs, unlike the -um- verbs, need not be nominalized. Thus: 

Nagbasag ako ng baso.  'I broke a glass.' 

Other bases in this subclass include: durog (dumurog/durugin 'pulverize'),giling (gumiling/gilingin 
'grind'), sunog (sumunog/sunugin 'burn'). 

Certain bases in subclass (2) also occur in -um-/-in verbs that do not require nominalization (as 
well as in mag-/-in verbs). The -um-/-in verbs (which belong to class E.2a, above) differ somewhat 
in meaning from the -um-(nom)/-in verbs (and mag-/-in verbs) formed with the same base, and 
denote the obtaining of part of an object by means of fragmenting it. Thus, for example, the 
-um-/-in verb formed with the base hiwa has the meaning 'slice off: 

Humiwa ka niyon.  'Slice (some of) that off.' 
Hiwain mo iyon.  'Slice that off.' 

while the um-(nom)/-in verb (as well as the mag-/-in verb) formed with the same base has the 
meaning 'slice': 

Ikaw ang humiwa noon.  'You slice (some of) that.' 
Hiwain mo iyon.  'Slice that.' 

(In the case of the verbs under discussion, only a non-nominalized -um- verb unambiguously 
expresses the meaning of obtaining by fragmenting. An -in verb, as the examples show, may have 
either this meaning or simply the meaning of fragmenting, while a nominalized -um- verb is also 
ambiguous, since it may represent either the -um-(nom)/-in class or a nominalization of the -um-
verb in the -um-/-in class. Thus 'Ikaw ang humiwa noon.' may also mean 'You slice (some of) that 
off.')

Some other bases that behave like hiwa are: bali (bumali/baliin 'break (off)'), gupit 
(gumupit/gupitin 'cut (off) (with scissors)'), putol (pumutol/putulin 'cut (off)'), taga 
(tumaga/tagain 'cut (off) (with a knife)'). 

§5.4. Affix—correspondence classes: directional verbs. 
The following presentation of the affix—correspondence classes identified with directional verbs 
parallels the presentation of the classes of object—verb bases in §5.3, except that the second affix listed in 
each affix set is a DF, rather than an OF, affix. 
A. Ma- classes 
1. ma-/-an (higa, tulog, upo)
* higa (mahiga/higaan 'lie on') 
* tulog (matulog/tulugan 'sleep in/on') 
* upo (maupo/upuan 'sit on') 
AF: Nahiga siya sa sahig.  'He lay on the floor.' 
DF: Hinigaan niya ang sahig.  'He lay on the floor.' 

Higa and upo occur in the -um-/-an directional-verb class (class D.l, below) as well as in the 
ma-/-an directional—verb class. In some dialects — but not in educated Manila Tagalog — tulog also 
occurs in the -um-/-an directional—verb class. (In derived formations, all three bases function as if 
they formed major AF verbs exclusively with -um-. Thus the aspectless gerunds formed with the bases 
(cf. §3.26) are paghiga, pagtulog, and pag-upo, forms that follow the pattern for -um- verb bases 
(pag- + base) rather than that for ma- verb bases (pagka- + base).) 

2. ma-/ka-an (hirati, muhi, suya, takot)
* hirati (mahirati/kahiratihan 'get used to') 
* muhi (mamuhi/kamuhian 'hate') 
* suya (masuya/kasuyaan 'be surfeited with') 
* takot (matakot/katakutan 'be afraid of ) 
AF: Nahihirati ako sa klima.  'I'm getting used to the climate.' 
DF: Kinahihiratian ko ang klima.  'I'm getting used to the climate.' 

3. ma-/pa-an (-kialam, -kibigay, -kinig, -kisama)
* -kialam (makialam/pakialaman 'meddle with') 
* -kibagay (makibagay/pakibagayan 'adapt oneself to') 
* -kinig (makinig/pakinggan 'listen to') 
* -kisama (makisama/pakisamahan 'get along with,' 'live with') 
AF: Nakikialam siyang palagi sa kanila.  'He is always meddling with them.' 
DF: Pinakikialaman niya silang palagi.  'He is always meddling with them.' 

It may be noted that the bases in this class all begin with ki-. This ki- is probably related 
historically to the prefix component ki- that occurs in social verbs (cf. §5.14), but it is most 
conveniently treated as part of the base in the case of the verbs under discussion. The elements 
that follow the ki- of -kialam, -kibagay and -kisama also occur independently: alam 'something 
known,' bagay 'suitable', sama 'company.' The element that follows the ki- of -kinig does not occur 
independently, but is perhaps a contracted form of dinig, the base of the object verb 
makarinig/marinig 'hear' (cf. §5.3, class B.l). (-kinig also occurs in the ma-/pa-. . . -an object—verb 
class — cf. §5.3, class A.3.) 

B. Mag- classes 
1. mag-/-an (bayad, maktol, masid, matyag)
* bayad (magbayad/bayaran 'make a payment to') 
* maktol (magmaktol/maktulan 'behave sulkily towards') 
* masid (magmasid/masdan 'look at') 
* matyag (magmatyag/matyagan 'observe cautiously') 
AF: Nagbayad siya sa bangko.  'He made a payment to the bank.'
DF: Binayaran niya ang bangko.  'He made a payment to the bank.'

It may be noted that most of the bases in this class begin with /m/, a phoneme that never 
occurs as the initial consonant of the base of an -um- verb (cf. §5.2, subsection (17)). This fact is 
probably relevant to the occurrence of these bases in the mag-/-an directional—verb class, rather 
than in the much larger -um-/-an directional—verb class (class D.l, below). 

The base bayad also occurs in the mag-/i-/-an double—object—verb class in the meaning 'pay in 
the form of' and in the mag-/-an object—verb class in the meaning 'pay for'. 

Maktol and masid also occur in the mag-/pag-an directional—verb class (class B.2, below). 

2. mag-/pag-an (hati, higanti, mataas, sawa)
* hati (maghati/paghatian 'share') 
* higanti (maghiganti/paghigantihan 'have revenge on') 
* mataas (magmataas/pagmataasan 'be snobbish toward') 
* sawa (magsawa/pagsawaan 'be tired of') 
AF: Naghati sila sa keyk.  'They shared the cake.' 
DF: Pinaghatian nila ang keyk.  'They shared the cake.' 

A number of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3) occur as bases of mag-frag-... -an directional verbs that 
express a meaning of assuming, or pretending to possess, the quality denoted by the adjective. 
Compare: mataas 'high,' magmataas/pagmataasan 'be snobbish toward (i.e., pretend to be higher 
than)'; mabait 'kind,' magmabait/pagmabaitan 'pretend to be kind to.' (There are also ma-
adjectives that occur as bases of intransitive mag- verbs expressing similar meanings — cf. §5.6, 
class G.) 

C. Mang- classes (very few bases in each class) 
1. mang-/-in (-pupo, panginoon)
* -pupo (mamupo/pupuin 'use po (respect particle) in addressing') 
* panginoon (mamanginoon/panginoonin 'serve') 
AF: Namumupo siya sa akin.  'He uses po in addressing me.' 
DF: Pinupupo niya ako.  'He uses po in addressing me.' 

2. mang-/ma- (talo)
* talo (manalo/matalo 'win against') 
AF: Nanalo ako kay Juan.  'I won against Juan.' 
DF: Natalo ko si Juan.  'I won against Juan.' 

3. mang-/pang-an (himasok, hinayang, pitagan)
* himasok (manghimasok/panghimasukan 'meddle in') 
* hinayang (manghinayang/panghinayangan 'regret the loss of') 
* pitagan (mamitagan/pamitaganan 'respect') 
AF: Nanghimasok sila sa gawain namin.  'They meddled in our affairs.' 
DF: Pinanghimasukan nila ang gawain namin.  'They meddled in our affairs.' 

D. -um- classes 

1. -um-/-an (dalo, hawak, punta, tulong)
* dalo (dumalo/daluhan 'attend') 
* hawak (humawak/hawakan 'hold on to') 
* punta (pumunta/puntahan 'go to') 
* tulong (tumulong/tulungan 'help') 
AF: Dadalo ka ba sa pulong?  'Will you attend the meeting?' 
DF: Dadaluhan mo ba ang pulong?  'Will you attend the meeting?' 

Hawak also occurs in the -um-/-an object—verb class (cf. §5.3, class E.l). The object—verb 
formations have the meaning 'hold.' 

2. -um-/-in (akyat, pasok, salungat, sunod)
* akyat (umakyat/akyatin 'climb') 
* pasok (pumasok/pasukin 'enter') 
* salungat (sumalungat/salungatin 'oppose') 
* sunod (sumunod/sundin 'follow') 
AF: Umakyat siya sa punong-mangga.  'He climbed the mango tree.' 
OF: Inakyat niya ang punong-mangga.  'He climbed the mango tree.' 

Akyat and pasok, like a number of other bases in the -um-/-in directional—verb class, also occur 
as bases of mag-/i-/-an double—object verbs (cf. §5.5, class A.l). The directional verbs express 
some movement of the actor from one place to another, while the double—object verbs express 
some movement of an object external to the actor from one place to another. 
Compare.umakyat/akyatin 'climb,' mag-akyat/iakyat/akyatan 'bring/take up to'.pumasok/pasukin 
'enter,' magpasok/ipasok/pasukan 'bring/take into'; lumabas/labasin 'come/go outside,' 
maglabas/ilabas/labasan 'bring/take outside.' 

§5.5. Affix—correspondence classes: double—object verbs. 
The following presentation of the affix—correspondence classes identified with double—object verb 
classes parallels the presentation of object—verb and directional—verb classes in § §5.3 and 5.4, except that 
each affix set includes three affixes: an AF affix, an OF affix, and a DF affix (which are listed in that 
order). 

A. Mag- classes 

1. mag-/i-/-an (abot, akyat, bigay, pasok)
* abot (mag-abot/iabot/abutan 'hand to') 
* akyat (mag-akyat/iakyat/akyatan 'bring/take up to') 
* bigay (magbigay/ibigay/bigyan 'give to') 
* pasok (magpasol/ipasok/pasukan 'bring/take into') 
AF: Nag-abot siya sa akin ng sulat.  'He handed me a letter.' 
OF: Iniabot niya sa akin ang sulat.  'He handed me the letter.' 
DF: Inabutan niya ako ng sulat.  'He handed me a letter.' 

Abot also occurs in the -um/-in object—verb class (cf. §5.3, class E.2a), in formations meaning 
'reach for.' 

For remarks on the occurrence of akyat, pasok, etc., in the -um/-in directional—verb class, cf. 
§5.4, class D.2. 

2. mag-/i-/-in (alok, balibag, bato, pukol)
* alok (mag-alok/ialok/alukin 'offer') 
balibag(magbalibag/ibalibag/balibagin 'throw at') 
* bato (magbato/ibato/batuhin 'stone with') 
* pukol (magpukol/ipukol/pukulin 'throw at') 
AF: Nag-alok siya sa akin ng kendi.  'He offered me some candy.' 
OF: Inialok niya sa akin ang kendi.  'He offered me the candy.' 
DF: Inalok niya ako ng kendi.  'He offered me some candy.' 

3. mag-/i-/pag-an (batay, bilin, bintang, sandal)
* batay (magbatay/ibatay/pagbatayan 'base (a decision) on') 
* bilin (magbilin/ibilin/pagbilinan 'entrust with') 
* bintang (magbintang/ibintang/pagbintangan 'accuse of') 
* sandal (magsandal/isandal/pagsandalan 'lean (something) against') 
AF: Nagbatay siya ng kapasyahan niya sa balita.  'He based a decision of his on the news report.' 
OF: Ibinatay niya ang kapasyahan niya sa balita.  'He based his decision on the news report.' 
DF: Pinagbatayan niya ng kapasyahan niya ang balita.  'He based a decision of his on the news report.' 

4. mag-/-in/-an (alis, dala, kuskos, tanggal)
* alis (mag-alis/alisin/alisan 'bring/take out of') 
* dala (magdala/dalhin/dalhan 'bring/take to') 
* kuskos (magkuskos/kuskusin/kuskusan 'scrape from') 
* tanggal (magtanggal/tanggalin/tanggalan 'detach from') 
AF: Mag-alis ka ng bigas sa sako.  'Take some rice out of the sack.' 
OF: Alisin mo ang bigas sa sako.  'Take the rice out of the sack.' 
DF: Alisan mo ng bigas ang sako.  'Take some rice out of the sack.' 

5. mag-/ipag-/pag-an (bili, kaila, kait, tapat)
* bili (magbili/ipagbili/pagbilhan 'sell to') 
* kaila (magkaila/ipagkaila/pagkailaan 'deny') 
* kait (magkait/ipagkait/pagkaitan 'refuse to give to') 
* tapat (magtapat/ipagtapat/pagtapatan 'confess to') 
AF: Nagbili siya sa kanila ng kasangkapan.  'He sold them some furniture.' 
OF: Ipinagbili niya sa kanila ang kasangkapan.  'He sold them the furniture.' 
DF: Pinagbilhan niya sila ng kasangkapan.  'He sold them some furniture.' 

Bili also occurs in the -um-/-in/-an double—ojbect—verb class (class B.2, below). The -um-/-in/-an 
formations have the meaning 'buy from.' 

Kaila also occurs in the mag-/i-/pag-an double—object—verb class (class A.3, above). The OF 
verbs ikaila and ipagkaila have the same meaning. 

B. Mang- class (very few bases) 

1. mang-/ipang-/pang-an (ako)
* ako (mangako/ipangako/pangakuan 'promise') 
AF: Nangakosiyasaakinngtulongniya.  'He promised me (some of) his help.' 
OF: Ipinangako niya sa akin ang tulong niya.  'He promised me his help.' 
DF: Pinangakuan niya ako ng tulong niya.  'He promised me (some of) his help.' 

C. -um- classes 
1. -um-/i-/-an (sulat)
* sulat (sumulat/isulat/sulatan 'write to') 
AF: Sumulat ako sa kaniya ng liham.  'I wrote him a letter.' 
OF: Isinulat ko sa kaniya ang liham.  'I wrote him the letter.' 
DF: Sinulatan ko siya ng liham.  'I wrote him a letter.' 

Sulat also occurs in the -um-/-in object—verb class (§5.3, class E.2a), in formations with the 
meaning 'write (creatively).' The -um-/i-/-an verb has, in addition to the meaning 'write to,' the 
meaning 'write on, make marks on,' as in: 

Sumulat ako ng pangalan ko sa papel.  'I wrote my name on the paper.' 
Isinulat ko ang pangalan ko sa papel.  'I wrote my name on the paper.' 
Sinulatan ko ng pangalan ko ang papel.  'I wrote my name on the paper.' 

As is the case with many other AF double-object verbs, sumulat need not be followed by both an
object complement and a directional complement, but may occur with only one. Thus, also: 

Sumulat ako ng liham.   'I wrote a letter.' 
Sumulat ako sa kaniya.  'I wrote  to him.' 

(The goal—focus counterparts of the above sentences are: 
Isinulat ko ang liham.  'I wrote the letter.' 
Sinulatan ko siya.  'I wrote to him.') 

2. -um-/-in/-an (awit, bili, hingi, hiram)
* awit (umawit/awitin/awitan 'sing to') 
* bili (bumili/bilhin/bilhan 'buy from') 
* hingi (humingi/hingin/hingan 'ask for') 
* hiram (humiram/hiramin/hiraman 'borrow from') 
AF: Aawit sila sa inyo ng kundiman.  'They will sing a kundiman to you.' 
OF: Aawitin nila sa inyo ang kundiman.  'They will sing the kundiman to you.' 
DF: Aawitan nila kayo ng kundiman.  'They will sing a kundiman to you.' 

Bili also occurs in the mag-/ipag-/pag-an double—object—verb class (class A.5, above). The 
mag-/ipag-/pag-an formations have the meaning 'sell to.' 

§ 5.6. Affix classes of major intransitive verbs. 

Major intransitive verbs are formed with one of ten affixes, each of which defines an affix class. 
Certain subclasses can be established within the affix classes on the basis of the types of sentence structures 
into which the verbs enter. In the presentation below, these classes are called: SIMPLE INTRANSITIVES, 
PSEUDO-TRANSITIVES , ADJUNCTIVES , and ADJUNCTIVE PSEUDO-TRANSITIVES . A simple 
intransitive (hereafter, SI) verb is one that accepts no adjuncts. (An ADJUNCT is one of certain structures 
that occur in a non-focus relationship to the verb, and that do not correspond to the topic of a related verb 
formed with the same base. Adjuncts are presented in detail in §5.26.) A pseudo—transitive (PT) verb is 
one that accepts an actor adjunct (a structure that is similar in form and meaning to the actor complement 
that occurs with a GF transitive verb). An adjunctive (A) verb does not accept an actor adjunct, but accepts 
an adjunct of some other type. An adjunctive pseudo—transitive (APT) verb accepts both an actor adjunct 
and an adjunct of some other type. 

A. -an class (bagal, kilabot, gupit, pawis, sakit, tamis)
bagal (bagalan 'make slow' PT) 
kilabot (kilabutan 'feel terrified' SI) 
gupit (gupitan 'cut' APT) 
pawis (pawisan 'sweat' SI) 
sakit (saktan 'have a pain in' A) 
tamis (tamisan 'make sweet' PT) 
Bagalan mo ang lakad mo.  'Walk slowly.' (Literally: 'Make your walking slow') 

SI, PT, A and APT verbs all occur (cf. §5.26, classes 1.1, II.A.l, III.A.l, III.B.l, and III.C.l), with PT 
and APT verbs in the majority. A subclass of PT verbs is formed with bases that also occur as the 
bases of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3); these verbs express the 'making' or 'producing' of the quality 
expressed by the adjective. (The base pawis also occurs in pagpawisan ~ pagpusan 'sweat,' an 
intransitive verb that alternates freely with pawisan, pagpawisan ~ pagpusan is apparently a unique 
example of an intransitive pag-... -an verb, and pag-... -an is not included in the present inventory 
of intransitive—verb affixes.) 

B. i- class (kasal, kaway, galaw, halal) (relatively few bases) 
kasal (ikasal 'get married to' A) 
kaway (ikaway 'wave (the hand)' PT) 
galaw (igalaw 'move (a part of the body)' PT) 
halal (ihalal 'elect' APT) 
Ikinasal siya kay Maria.  'He got married to Maria.' 

The intransitive verbs formed with i- are all A, PT, or APT (cf. §5.26, classes (1.2, II.B.1, and 
III.C.2). The majority of them are PT verbs expressing the movement of some part of the body. 

C. -in class (agad, antok, kulang, hintay, langgam) (relatively few bases) 
agad (agarin 'do without delay' PT) 
antok (antukin 'feel sleepy' SI) 
kulang (kulangin 'be short of A) 
hintay (hintayin 'wait for.. . to' APT) 
langgam (langgamin 'be infested with ants' SI) 
Agarin mo ang kampanya.  'Campaign without delay' 

SI, PT, A and APT verbs all occur (cf. §5.26, classes 1.3, II.A.2, II.C.l, and III.C.3). Most nouns 
that designate insects may occur as bases of SI -in verbs that express the meaning of being infested 
with the specified insect. Compare: langgam 'ant,' langgamin 'be infested with ants'; lamok 
'mosquito,' lamukin 'be infested with mosquitoes,' etc. 

D. Ma- class (bingi, basag, huli, mahal, -matay, tukso) (most are unaffixed adjectives)
bingi (mabingi 'become deaf SI) 
basag (mabasag 'get broken' SI) 
huli (mahuli 'catch (someone doing something)' APT) 
mahal (mamahal 'become expensive' SI) 
-matay (mamatay 'die' SI) 
tukso (matukso 'be tempted (to)' A) 
Nabibingi ang Lolo.  'Grandfather is becoming deaf.' 

Most of the bases that occur in this class also occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2), and the SI 
verbs they form, which may be called ma- VERBS OF 'BECOMING,' denote the acquisition of the 
quality expressed by the adjective; their usual English equivalents involve 'become' or 'get' plus an 
adjective. Compare: bingi 'deaf,' mabingi 'become deaf'; basag 'broken,' mabasag 'get broken,' etc. 
As is noted in §4.2, some unaffixed adjectives that lack penultimate vowel length are related to 
nouns that show such length: e.g., basag /basag/ 'broken,' basag /ba:sag/ '(a) break.'  When adjectives 
such as these occur as bases of ma- verbs of becoming, they are identical in form with the related 
nouns, and show penultimate vowel length: e.g., mabasag /maba:sag/ 'get broken.' (See also the 
discussion of -um- verbs of 'becoming' under J, below.) 

A few A and APT ma- verbs also occur (cf. §5.26, classes II.A.3 and III.C.2). 

E. Ma-an class (anghang, alat, init, lamig)
anghang (maanghangan 'find (something) biting in taste' A) 
alat (maalatan 'find (something) salty' A) 
init (mainitan 'feel hot,' 'find (something) hot' SI or A) 
lamig (malamigan 'feel cold,' 'find (something) cold' SI or A) 
Naanghangan siya sa sili.  'He found the pepper biting in taste.' 

Most of the bases in this class also occur as the bases of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3). The verbs have 
the meaning of attributing to something the quality expressed by the adjective (in which case they are 
A) and/or of experiencing the quality expressed by the adjective (in which case they are SI). 

Compare: maanghang 'biting in taste,' maanghangan 'find (something) biting in taste'; mainit 'hot,' 
mainitan 'feel hot,' 'find (something) hot.' (For a presentation of the adjuncts taken by ma-an 
verbs, cf. §5.26, classes II.A.4, II.B.2, and II.C.3). 

F. Maka- class (daan, daos, sulit) (relatively few bases) 
daan (makaraan 'be over' SI) 
daos (makaraos 'be over' SI) 
sulit (makasulit 'pass (in an examination)' A) 
Nakaraan na ang pista.  'The fiesta is over now.' 

The few verbs in this class are SI or A (cf. §5.26, class II.B.3). 

(Certain intransitive verbs formed with maka- may be analyzed as optional contractions of the 
ability/involuntary—action forms of intransitive indirect—action verbs — cf. §§5.12 and 5.13. 

Examples are: makaalat ~ makapagpaalat 'make salty' (literally, 'be able to cause to become 
salty' — cf. umalat 'become salty'), makatamis ~ makapagpatamis 'make sweet' (cf. tumamis 'become 
sweet'). Like other indirect—action verbs, the maka- verbs take a secondary—actor complement such 
as the ng phrase in Nakatamis ng kape ang asukal 'The sugar made the coffee sweet.') 

G. Mag- class (abogado, atubili, bus, kamayan, hiwalay, mabagal, madaling-araw, -sa-Kastila)
abogado (mag-abogado 'become a lawyer' SI) 
atubili (mag-atubili 'hesitate to' A) 
bus (magbus 'ride a bus' SI) 
kamayan (magkamayan 'exchange handshakes' SI) 
hiwalay (maghiwalay 'separate from one another' SI) 
mabagal (magmabagal 'be slow (in)' SI or A) 
madaling-araw (magmadaling-araw 'be dawn' SI) 
-sa-Kastila (magsa-Kastila 'be like a Spaniard' SI) 
Nag-aabogado si Juan.  'Juan is becoming a lawyer.' 

Most intransitive mag- verbs are SI; a few are A (cf. §5.26, class II.C.5). 

Many of the bases that occur in this class also occur as unmarked nouns. In the case of nouns 
designating a member of a profession, the verbs express the meaning of becoming a member of this 
profession. Compare: abogado 'lawyer,' mag-abogado 'become a lawyer'; maestro 'teacher,' 
magmaestro 'become a teacher'; nars 'nurse,' magnars 'become a nurse.' In other cases, the verb may 
express the meaning of making use of the item designated by the noun in the normal or appropriate 
way: e.g., riding, for vehicles (bus 'bus,' magbus 'ride a bus'); wearing, for articles of clothing 
(kurbata 'tie,' magkurbata 'wear a tie'); speaking, for languages (toggles 'English,' mag-Inggles 'speak 
English'); smoking, for tobacco (sigarilyo 'cigarette,' magsigarilyo 'smoke (cigarettes)'), etc. Or the 
verb may express the meaning of producing the item designated by the noun: e.g., asin 'salt,' 
mag-asin 'produce salt,' bunga 'fruit,' magbunga 'bear fruit,' etc. 

There are two subclasses of intransitive mag- verbs that express reciprocal or joint actions involving 
two or more actors: one formed with bases that also occur as derived nouns ending in the suffix -an 
(cf. §3.7, subsection (2)), the other formed with bases that do not include the suffix -an. Some 
examples of verbs in the first subclass are: magkamayan 'exchange handshakes' (cf. kamayan 
'exchange of handshakes'), magsaksakan 'stab one another' (cf. saksakan 'stabbing one another'), 
magtakbuhan 'run together' (cf. takbuhan 'running together'). Some examples of verbs in the second 
subclass are: mag-away 'quarrel with one another' (cf. away '(a) quarrel'), magsalubong 'greet one 
another' (cf. salubong 'greeting'), (cf. also §5.16, subsection (4), for a presentation of multiple 
reciprocal verbs.) 

There is also a subclass of intransitive mag- verbs formed with ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3 and §5.18, 
subsection (2.b.l)) as bases. The verbs denote assuming, or pretending to possess, the quality 
designated by the adjective. Compare: mabagal 'slow,' magmabagal 'be slow (in),' madali 'fast,' 
magmadali 'hurry (in),' mayaman 'rich,' magmayaman 'pretend to be rich.' (Ma- adjectives also occur 
as the bases of mag-/pag-... -an directional verbs of similar meaning - cf. §5.3, class B.2.) 
Intransitive mag- verbs with bases expressing times of day (e.g., magmadaling-araw 'be dowwn' — cf. 
madaling-araw 'down') and other natural phenomena occur in topicless phenomenal sentences (cf. 
§7.21 for further examples and discussion). Intransitive mag- verbs with bases consisting of sa- plus a 
noun designating a person denote the assumption of the behavior of the person or type of person 
designated by the noun. Compare: Kastila 'Spaniard,' magsa-Kastila 'behave like a Spaniard.' (Cf. 
§5.18, subsection (2.C.4) for further examples.) 

H. Mang- class (bangka, kimi, kupas, -nginig, pula)
bangka (mamangka 'go boating' SI) 
kimi (mangimi 'be hesitant to' A) 
kupas (mangupas 'fade' SI) 
-nginig (manginig 'tremble' SI) 
pula (mamula 'blush, redden' SI) 
Mamangka tayo.  'Let's go boating.' 

Most of the verbs in this class are SI; a few are A (cf. §5.26, class II.c.5). 

A number of bases that occur in this class also occur as unmarked nouns. The mang- verbs often 
denote activities — particularly recreational activities — involving the items designated by the nouns. 
Compare: bangka 'boat'; mamangka 'go boating'; kabayo 'horse,' mangabayo 'go horseback riding'; 
isda 'fish,' mangisda 'go fishing,' etc. 

There is also a subclass of mang- verbs whose bases occur as unaffixed adjectives or as the bases of 
ma- adjectives (cf. §4.2 and 4.3). The mang- verb designates the temporary or partial acquisition of 
the quality expressed by the adjective. Compare: kupas 'colorless,' mangupas 'fade'; pula 'red,' 
mamula 'blush, redden'; puti 'white,' mamuti 'blanch'; masakit 'painful,' manakit 'ache'; matigas 
'hard,' manigas 'become stiff.' 

I. pang-an class (hina, pula, -nginig, sakit) (relatively few bases) 
hina (panghinaan 'feel a weakness in' A) 
pula (pamulahan 'have a reddening of A) 
-nginig (panginigan 'have a tremor in' A) 
sakit (panaktan 'have a pain in' A) 
Pinanghinaan siya ng bisig.  'He felt a weakness in the arm.' 

All verbs in this class are A, and express the undergoing of something in a part of the body. 

J. -um- class (bagyo, buti, dami, dating, -pasa-Maynila, sainyo)
bagyo (bumagyo 'storm' SI) 
buti (bumuti 'become good, improve (in)' SI) 
dami (dumami 'become much, be mor than' SI or A) 
dating (dumating 'arrive' SI) 
-pasa-Maynila (pumasa-Maynila 'go to Manila' SI) 
sainyo (sumainyo 'be yours' SI) 
Bumabagyo na.  'It's storming now.' 

SI verbs like bumagyo, formed with bases that designate natural conditions (cf. bagyo 
'storm'), occur in topicless sentences (cf. §7.21). Other examples are: kumidlat 'be lightning' 
(cf. kidlat 'lightning'), gumabi 'get on toward nighttime' (cf. gabi 'night'), umulan 'rain' (cf. 
ulan 'rain'). 

Many of the bases that occur in intransitive (SI or A) -um- verbs also occur as the bases of ma-
adjectives (cf. §4.3), and the verbs, which may be called -um- VERBS OF 'BECOMING,' denote the 
acquisition of the quality expressed by the adjective. Their usual English equivalents are 'become' or 
'get' plus an adjective. Compare: mabuti 'good,' bumuti 'become good, improve'; malaki 'big,' lumaki 
'get big, grow'; matanda 'old,' tumanda 'get old, age.' The bases of a few -um- verbs of 'becoming' also 
occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2), rather than as ma- adjective bases. Compare: payat 'thin,' 
pumayat 'become thin.' (most unaffixed adjectives occur as bases of ma- verbs of 'becoming' — cf. 
class D, above — rather than -um- verbs of 'becoming.') 

There is a subclass of SI -um- verb bases related to locative adjective phrases (cf. §4.19). In the 
verb bases, the na- of the adjective phrase is replaced by pa- /pa/; compare: nasa Maynila 'in Manila,' 
pumasa-Maynila 'go to Manila.' There is also a subclass related to possessive sa phrases (cf. §4.22); 
compare: sa inyo 'yours,' sumainyo 'be yours.' (For further examples of verbs like pumasa-Maynila 
and sumainyo, cf. §5.18, subsection (4.a). For a presentation of A -um- verbs, cf. §5.26, classes
II.A.7, II.B.4, and II.C.6.)
