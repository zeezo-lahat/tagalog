grammar section 7 (p. 281)

7.1 potential forms (abilitive)
maka(pag)- active
ma- direct
ma-an local

almost all verbs may have potential forms

for some mag- verbs, pag- is inserted after the potential active (maka) and local passive (ma-an)
forms, but not after direct passive (ma-) forms.

for mang- verbs, pang- may be put after the prefixes.

7.11 some verbs have a potential form with a long vowel on the prefix. ex:
makArinig nakArinig nakAkarinig makAkarinig
mArinig nArinig nAririnig mAririnig
mAtirhan nAtirhan nAtitirhan mAtitirhan

the reduplicated vowel in the root tends to be shortened.  dialects differ though.
some retain the long vowel in the root:
nArIrinig, nAtItirahan
or shorten the vowel in the prefix:
narIrinig, natItirhan (Manila)

7.2 meanings

7.21 past potential: managed to do, happened to do, succeeded in doing, had a chance to do, did
accidentally

7.22 present potential:
1) abilitive   - nakAkabAsa ka ba?  can you read
2) repeated/general opportunity or repeated accidental/incidental
3) something that has not yet had a chance to happen, with "hindi pa", eg "hindi pa nakAkahAnap": not yet been able to find
note that, the negative (eg, hindi nakAka-) means *physically* unable, not just temporary inability

7.23 future potential:
a) will be able to happen
b) will succeed in happening
c) will happen to someone
also used in clauses introduced by "kung", as it requires future tense

7.24 dependent tense (infinitive)
1) cannot or will not be able to (temporarily, as opposed to the present potential)
2) other contexts which require the dependent, eg after para, baka, gusto, etc. (see p. 115)

7.4 local potential meaning "happen to someone"
for some roots, the local passive potential means "happen to someone"
