grammar section 5

5.4 The direct object with active verbs is (1) a dative of the pronoun or (2) the dative particle
before a name or title (kay or kina) or (3) ng plus a noun or phrase.  Note the direct object
marker ng is written separate from what precedes it.  The direct object of an active verb must 
follow the verb.

51. Kayo bang dalawa ang naghAhanap ng kwArto?  "Are both of you looking for a room?"
53. Lagi silang naghAhandA ng isda.  "They always serve fish."

If the direct object of the active verb is a proper noun or a pronoun, the dative form is used.

54. Ako na lang ang mattAtanong kay Mr. OcAmpo.  "I'll be the one to ask Mr. Ocampo."
55. Sino kayA ang gustong maghintay sa iyo? "Who would want to wait for you?"

However, the genitive of the demonstrative pronoun is used as the direct object of active verbs.
For example, in the following sentence "noong libro" ("those books") is the direct object of the
active verb "bumili":

56. Ako ang bumili noong mga libro (or "ng mga librong iyon").  "I was the one who bought those
books."

With a verb that refers to motion, the direct object is introduced by sa or ng alternatively.

57.  Sa Sabado pa siya bAbalik ng (or "sa") Maynila.  "He will only be going back to Manila on
Saturday."

grammar section 7 (p. 281)

7.1 potential forms (abilitive)
maka(pag)- active
ma- direct
ma-an local

almost all verbs may have potential forms

for some mag- verbs, pag- is inserted after the potential active (maka) and local passive (ma-an)
forms, but not after direct passive (ma-) forms.

for mang- verbs, pang- may be put after the prefixes.

7.11 some verbs have a potential form with a long vowel on the prefix. ex:
makArinig nakArinig nakAkarinig makAkarinig
mArinig nArinig nAririnig mAririnig
mAtirhan nAtirhan nAtitirhan mAtitirhan

the reduplicated vowel in the root tends to be shortened.  dialects differ though.
some retain the long vowel in the root:
nArIrinig, nAtItirahan
or shorten the vowel in the prefix:
narIrinig, natItirhan (Manila)

7.2 meanings

7.21 past potential: managed to do, happened to do, succeeded in doing, had a chance to do, did
accidentally

7.22 present potential:
1) abilitive   - nakAkabAsa ka ba?  can you read
2) repeated/general opportunity or repeated accidental/incidental
3) something that has not yet had a chance to happen, with "hindi pa", eg "hindi pa nakAkahAnap": not yet been able to find
note that, the negative (eg, hindi nakAka-) means *physically* unable, not just temporary inability

7.23 future potential:
a) will be able to happen
b) will succeed in happening
c) will happen to someone
also used in clauses introduced by "kung", as it requires future tense

7.24 dependent tense (infinitive)
1) cannot or will not be able to (temporarily, as opposed to the present potential)
2) other contexts which require the dependent, eg after para, baka, gusto, etc. (see p. 115)

7.4 local potential meaning "happen to someone"
for some roots, the local passive potential means "happen to someone"
