Huwág mong kalimutan ang ipinabibilí ko sa iyó.	Don't forget what I'm asking you to buy for me.
Nakabilí ka ba ng ipinabibilí ko sa iyó?	Were you able to buy what I asked you to buy for me?
Bukas siguro akó makákabilí ng ipinabibilí mo.	I might be able to buy tomorrow what you asked me to buy for you.
Nahirapan akóng maghanáp nitóng ipinabibilí mo.	I had a tough time looking for this thing that you asked me to buy for you.
