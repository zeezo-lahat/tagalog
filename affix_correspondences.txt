mang -> ipang

CAUSATIVE-FOCUS (CF) verbs form predicates that select as topics nominals expressing the cause 
of the action. They are derived from transitive and intransitive -um-, ma-, mag- and mang- verbs.

The topic of a CF verb corresponds to a nominal within a "dahil sa" phrase occurring as a causative 
adverb

AF Affix CF Affix 
um  ->  i, ika
ma  ->  ika
mag  ->  i(ka)pag
mang  ->  i(ka)pang

(The notations i(ka)pag- and i(ka)pang- indicate free alternation between the forms with and without ka. 
Thus: ipag- ~ ikapag-, ipang- ~ ikapang-.) 

Of the two CF counterparts of -um-, ika- is the more common. Generally, intransitive -um- verbs of 
'becoming' (cf. §5.6, class J) have corresponding causative—focus verbs formed with either i- or ika-, the two 
occurring as free alternants.

A LOCATIVE-FOCUS (LF) verb forms a predicate that selects as topic a nominal expressing the 
location of the action.

AF Affix LF Affix 
ma  ->  ka-an, pag-an 
maka  ->  ka-an 
um  ->  pag-an 
mag  ->  pag-an 
mang  ->  pang-an 

A2F indirect-action verbs select as topics nominals denoting the person(s), etc. permitted or caused to 
perform the action of the verb. They are derived from certain transitive or intransitive AF direct—action verbs

mag  ->  papag-in 
mang  ->  papang-in
