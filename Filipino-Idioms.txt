Filipino/Tagalog Idioms

   Learning idioms may not sound appealing to a foreign language learner
   as an idiom often conveys a meaning entirely different from the literal
   meaning. There is always a hidden message waiting to be unlocked and
   understood for every idiom. Filipino idioms arenʼt different. Known as
   sawikain in Filipino, the countryʼs official language, Filipino idioms
   are still pretty much used these days. While most of these idioms
   convey an entirely different meaning from the literal interpretation,
   some of these somehow gives off a hint as the word reflects the idiomʼs
   true meaning.

   Filipino/Tagalog idioms, often comprised of group of words with a
   meaning that completely has nothing to do with any of the words in the
   phrase. To a Filipino language learner, these idioms might sound
   discouraging to learn and most likely maybe last on the list, but they
   are a great way to step up on the learning process. The reward of
   learning Filipino idioms? Being able to understand some of these idioms
   once heard or spoken allowing you to blend in more and carry out
   conversations without feeling left out.

   With that said, challenge yourself as you continuously learn the
   Filipino language by learning these idioms. Impress and surprise your
   friends what youʼve learned. This time, with Filipino/Tagalog idioms.
   What are the commonly used Filipino idioms? That, in this list of 30
   commonly used Filipino idioms with their literal meaning, what they
   really mean and their English counterpart if there is. Some includes
   examples too.

Balat sibuyas

   Balat means skin. The word is also used in Filipino when referring to
   fruit rinds or outer cover of vegetables and root crops. Sibuyas means
   onion. But putting these two together, this Filipino idiom means a
   sensitive person. ʼBalat sibuyasʼ literally means ʼonion skin.ʼ

Kutong lupa

   The Filipino word kuto refers to head louse while lupa means soil and
   is also used to refer to the ground. Putting these two words together
   giving us our idiom ʼkutong lupaʼ literally means ʼsoil louseʼ or
   ʼground louse.ʼ An idiom that is often used by someone irritated when
   referring to small kids.

   Ang ingay ng mga kutong lupa na ʼto!

   These kids are too noisy!

Maamong tupa

   The first word is a Filipino adjective that means domesticated. Tupa on
   the other hand means sheep. ʼMaamong tupaʼ literally means domesticated
   sheep. A Filipino idiom that has nothing to do with the sheep but most
   likely mirrors how sweet looking these animals are. Maamong tupa is
   your Filipino idiom for someone playing goody goody.

   The close English counterpart for this Filipino idiom is ʼA wolf in
   sheepʼs skin.ʼ That someone pretending to be sweet, nice and harmless.

   Para siyang maamong tupa kapag andyan ka.

   Sheʼs like a sweet angel when youʼre around.
