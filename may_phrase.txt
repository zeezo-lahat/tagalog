may, mayroon, marami, wala are all considered may-phrases

trg does not seem to cover cases like this one, which is neither existential, possessive, nor indefinite:

May hallway akong pinasukan at maya-maya may narating akong isang pintuan.      I entered into a hallway and shortly afterward I arrived at a door.

And:

Pero minsan may ginagamit silang shortcut ang tramline ng barangay.

These are goal focus verbs with topic actors as below for indefinite may phrases.

trg p.279:
Existential may phrases, like possessive may phrases (cf. ยง4.22), normally consist of may (or 
mayroon plus the linker -ng, marami plus the linker -ng) followed by a noun.

Sentences with existential-phrase predicates differ from those with possessive-phrase predicates in the absence 
of a topic.  ("May libro" vs "May libro si Paul.")

trg p.276:


indefinite may phrases:

If the verb in an indefinite may-phrase predicate is a *goal-focus* verb, the sentence has a topic, which 
represents the performer of the action of the verb. 

(Note that the performer of the action is *not* expressed by a ng-phrase actor complement, as it is in other 
constructions that involve goal-focus verbs. 

Compare, for example: 
May ginawa ang Amerikano.	'The American did something.' 
and: 
Ginawa ng Amerikano iyon.	'The American did that.'
)
