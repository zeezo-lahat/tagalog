Sabi ko'y sarhan ang bunganga mo!	I said shut up!
May taong dumadaldal dahil lamang may bunganga sila.	There are people who talk just because they have a mouth.
Hindi ko alam kung paano siya nakakasalita nang may sagarilyo sa bunganga.	I don't understand how he can speak with a cigarette in his mouth.
